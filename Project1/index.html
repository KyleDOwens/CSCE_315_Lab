            <img src="self_photo.jpeg" width="300" height="370"> 
            <p>Howdy! My name is Kyle Owens. I am a student at Texas A&M pursuing a degree in <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/ce/index.html">Computer Engineering</a> and a minor in Mathematics.
                I am expected to graduate Spring of 2023, and am looking to attend grad school to earn my Masters in Computer Science.
                A few topics I am interested in are computer arcitecture, compilers, programming languages, and software development. At the
                moment I am looking to gain experience in any field related to computer science or electrical engineering. Take a look around
                my webpage, and feel to free to contact me if you have an question! Thanks and Gig 'em!
            </p>

                <h4>Tutoring</h4>
                <p>For the past 4 year I have tutored students in my community in my free time. I teach high school students and
                    college freshman, and primarily focus on high school math, physics, computer Science, and chemistry as my main tutored 
                    subjects. I find it very fun and rewarding to help those around me with school, especially during the past few
                    years with COVID and it being difficult for some kids to get the attention they needed to learn.
                    I set up zoom calls with those around me in my neighborhood, or those who went to my old schools and would help
                    them with what they needed.</p>

                <p>I am a member of the <a href="https://linktr.ee/hullabalooband">TAMU Hullabaloo Pep Band</a>. This is a organization 
                    which plays at all of the Women's Soccer, Women's Volleyball, Women's Basketball, and Men's Basketball home games at
                    A&M. We have the goal of promoting school spirit, and to provide support to the A&M Athletics teams. If you ever
                    attend any of the above sporting games listed above, you will hear to band play, chant, and cheer the whole game though.

                <h4>Slide Puzzle Solver</h4>
                <p>I completed this project in a course offered at A&M called CSCE 462 Microcomputer Systems.
                    The project uses a Raspberry Pi, camera, and an LCD Display. This is a device that is capable
                    of solving a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle">15-slide puzzle</a> and presenting the solution to the user. 
                    The device first takes a picture of the board in its unsolved state. Then, the image is sent to our image processing software,
                    which whill identify the edges of the board and crop the image into 16 smaller piece(1 image for each tile). Then, a convolutional
                    neural network will identify which number is on which tile. This information is passed to the puzzle solving algorithm, which uses
                    a variation of the A* search algorithm to determine a method to solve the puzzle. Finally, the resulting moves will be presented to
                    the user on an LCD Display that they can solve along with. More details about the project can be found in our 
                    <a href="SlidePuzzleSolver_FinalReport.pdf">final report</a> and a demonstration of it working 
                    can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JxdvogXGEO8">here</a> or in the video shown on the screen.

                <h4>Baby Sleep Monitoring</h4>
                <p>During the summer of 2021 I participated in the <a href="https://sec.tamu.edu/">SEC Directed Internship</a> put together by Texas A&M.
                This was a 7-week summer program, where my group was assigned the problem of finding a way to monitor a baby's breathing while it is sleeping
                without touching the baby. We were tasked with creating a product, working out how it could be produced, estimated the financial gain/loss, and
                then give a presentation to a team of industry professionals. The product we came up with was a thin pad that you woud put under the baby's matress
                that would track the baby's breathing rate, and alert the parent if the baby every stopped breathing. Our final presentation for this can be viewed 
                <a href="secdi.pdf">here</a> or downloaded <a href="secdi.pdf" attributes-list download>here</a>.

                <p>This is the website you are currently viewing. More information about the processing of creating
                    the website and the lessons learned from is will be writin in more detail in this section once
                    the website is complete. All the files for this website can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/KyleDOwens/CSCE_315_Lab">github</a>.
                    As progress is made on the website this section will be updated. There are plans to include multiple CSS styles for this website that can be
                    changed at the click of a button. This project is giving me lots of experience working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The primary websites
                    that I used to learn were <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html">Code Academy</a> for HTML and 
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">W3 School</a> for CSS.
